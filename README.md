# Decsription 

This is an assignment given in the finals of the cryptography course which I took in 3rd Year.

It's a simple User Interface which allows the user to encrypt / decrypt a given input using two methods:

## 1. Luigi Sacco
Luigi Sacco is a columnar transposition encryption method.


## 2. Route Encryption
Route encryption arranges the given input in a predefined matrix, and then extracts an encrypted message from this matrix by following a predefined 'path'.
